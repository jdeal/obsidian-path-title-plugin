## Usage

After you install, you'll get the behavior shown above, where the full path will show before the filename. There are few general options in the settings to change the appearance:

**Path Position:** Show the path before or after the filename.

**Path Font Size:** Make the path bigger or smaller.

**Path Border:** Whether or not the path has a border around it.

## Advanced Usage

The path replacement settings allow you to shorten or otherwise modify the path however you want. You can add multiple replacement settings, and they will all run in order from first to last.

### Exact Path Replacement

You can replace an exact match of the whole path with an alternate path. For example, here we replace "Notes/Ideas" with "üí°".

### Exact Folder Replacement

### Text Replacement

You can replace text anywhere in the path with alternate text. For example, here we replace "001." with "1.". This allows you to change multiple paths with a single rule.

### Regular Expression Replacement

You can use a regular expression to match text anywhere in the path and replace it with alternate text, using $1, $2, etc. to insert groups matched by the regular expression.
